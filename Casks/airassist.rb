# Bump `version` + `sha256` on every release. The rest is static.
# SHA256 comes from SHA256SUMS.txt attached to the GitHub Release
# (or `shasum -a 256 AirAssist-<version>.dmg`).

  # We ship ad-hoc signed builds (no $99/yr Developer ID). Recent
  # Homebrew versions tag cask downloads with `com.apple.quarantine`,
  # which — on macOS Sequoia and newer — causes Gatekeeper to show the
  # "Apple could not verify…" dialog on first launch. We strip the
  # attribute in a postflight so the app opens cleanly on first run,
  # matching the experience users reasonably expect from a brew-
  # installed tool. The signature, bundle contents, and SHA256 are
  # unchanged — this only removes the first-launch quarantine flag,
  # same as a user running `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` manually.
